# RSpec Improved

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is basically just an updated version of [Better RSpec](https://github.com/fnando/better-rspec-for-sublime-text). I couldn't make the settings work so I upgraded everything to work nicely with sublime text 3.

The RSpec syntax definition is updated and improved.
